# Provisional Topic Description

## Title
Optimizing Text Preprocessing for Interpretable Topic Models: A Data Mining Study

## Description

This provisional working topic investigates how systematic variations in text cleaning and normalization steps directly impact the coherence and human interpretability of topics generated by probabilistic topic models. Specifically, this research will examine the influence of fundamental preprocessing operations—including stop-word removal, lemmatization, stemming, tokenization strategies, and n-gram construction—on the quality and interpretability of topics extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related unsupervised learning algorithms.

The study focuses on a foundational aspect of the natural language processing pipeline that is often treated as routine but critically shapes downstream model performance. By employing controlled experimental designs across diverse text corpora, this research will systematically evaluate how different preprocessing configurations affect topic coherence metrics, semantic consistency, and human-judged interpretability. The investigation will utilize data mining methodologies to identify optimal preprocessing strategies that maximize topic model transparency and usability.

This provisional topic addresses a significant gap in understanding the preprocessing-interpretation relationship in topic modeling, with potential implications for information retrieval, document clustering, and text analytics applications. The research aims to provide evidence-based guidelines for practitioners implementing interpretable topic models in real-world data mining contexts.
